## Overview

This demo shows the different pillars of object oriented programming - ABSTRACTION, ENCAPSULATION, POLYMORPHISM, and INHERITANCE.

There is a parent Bed class and a King size bed class that inherits from it. The Bed class uses encapsulation to protect the data and use getters/setters for accessing it. The King size bed class uses polymorphism to add a new method to get the extraWidth variable.

Using Abstraction, there is a DisplayBedInfo script that will display the info of each bed object in a reusable way.
